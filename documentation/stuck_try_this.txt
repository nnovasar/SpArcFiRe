Notes:
*When compiling the doHacClustering.cpp, use gcc/g++ version 4.9 or below (version 5 and above are not supported by matlab r2017a).

*When compiling matlab, matlab changes paths to reflect environment it was compiled in.
ex) If I (wschallo) compiled a code containing the following line of code:
          galfitTemplate = fopen('~/bin/GalfitTemplates/template.feedme','r');
    It would be translated to:
          galfitTemplate = fopen('/home/wschallo/bin/GalfitTemplates/template.feedme','r');
    At compile time
 To resolve this, create a variable that retrives the user name, and plug-it in to the path.
